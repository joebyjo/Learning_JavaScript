    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 135%;">This Lasagna recipe is full of layers of delicious ground meat, marinara sauce, and ooey-gooey cheese. <br> It’s the definition of decadence!
        Having three different components, lasagna is not the easiest thing to make. <br> But it only takes one whiff of this Italian masterpiece to know that it’s worth it.

    <h2 style="font-weight: 300; padding-bottom: 1px;">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;font-size: 120%; list-style: circle;">
        <li>1/2 box Barilla Wavy Lasagne</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage or ground beef (cooked and drained)</li>
        <li>2 jars Barilla Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>1 15-oz container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-weight: 300; padding-bottom: 1px;">Directions</h2>
    <ol style="margin: auto; font-family: monospace;font-size: 120%;">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles in boiling water for 4 minutes and drain with a colander. 
            <br> Run it through cold water to stop from further cooking. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, mix sausage or ground beef and 1 1/12 of the marinara sauce. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix Ricotta, 3 1/2 cups of mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and eggs.</li>
        <li>Grease a lasagna pan or a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce over the baking dish, about 3/4 cup.
             <br>Layer 3 to 5 lasagna noodles over the sauce.
             The noodles should only overlap <br> slightly with each other. Layer the cheese mixture of the noodles, followed by the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers starting from the noodles to the meat sauce twice. Top the meat sauce with the remaining marinara sauce and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
